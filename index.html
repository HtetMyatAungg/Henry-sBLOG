    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This paper explores the impacts of nationwide internet censorship, specifically firewalls, on students and teens in Myanmar (Burma). It investigates how restricted access to information affects academic performance, social interactions, and psychological well-being among youth. Through survey data and interviews with students affected by such restrictions, this study highlights both the limitations and coping mechanisms developed by young people facing internet censorship. The findings reveal that while firewalls create educational and social obstacles, students often adapt by finding alternative ways to access information, albeit sometimes at personal or legal risk.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        In recent years, internet censorship has intensified in many countries, leading to what are known as nationwide firewalls—sophisticated systems that restrict access to a wide range of online content. These restrictions are often enacted to control the flow of information within a country’s borders and to shape public perception. For students and teens, however, firewalls have unique impacts as they limit access to educational resources, global perspectives, and social platforms.
This paper seeks to explore how internet censorship affects the academic and personal development of young people who rely on the internet for learning, socializing, and personal growth. The research question guiding this study is: How does a nationwide firewall affect students and teens in terms of their education, social relationships, and mental health? By examining this issue, we can better understand the balance between national policies on censorship and the digital rights of young people.
